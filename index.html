        <p>My name is Stefan, I am 28 years old and regarding my studies I am enthusiastic about language acquisition, multilingualism and German as a foreign language in the context of adult education.</p>
        <p>The photographies you can see show me and some things I like, such as movement, my dog, nature, and art.</p>
